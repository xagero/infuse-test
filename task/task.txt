Please find below a task for proficiency level evaluation:
The project should consist of at least the following 3 files:
 - index1.html
 - index2.html
 - banner.php
 and 1 MySQL table with the next mandatory columns:
 - ip_address
 - user_agent
 - view_date
 - page_url
 - views_count
  index1.html and index2.html should have an image tag that inserts some image into the page using banner.php
  file: ​<img src="banner.php">
    Every time the image is loaded, the page visitor's info should be recorded in the MySQL table:
- IP address of the visitor (ip_address column)
- Their user-agent (user_agent column)
- The date and time the image was shown for this visitor (view_date column)
- URL of the page where the image was loaded (page_url column)
- Number of image loads for the same visitor (views_count column)
- conditions are described below.
If a user with the same IP address, user-agent, and page URL hits the page again,
 the view_date column has to be updated with the current date and time, as well as views_count column has to be increased by 1.

     - 4 files: 2 HTML files, 1 PHP file, and a dump file (.sql) of the table (CREATE+INSERT) - (optional) ​
     Additional PHP for classes, methods, or any other staff, if necessary - (optional) ​
